GameCube/Wii Memory Manager is an aplication to backup Nintendo GameCube savegames.

Gcmm is a project started by dsbomb and justb, which is based on Askot's modification to add SD support to the mcbackup libogc example.

I (suloku) have updated the code to newest libraries to port it to the Wii system, and what I find more important: restoring savegames now works properly.

    Wii
----------
Currently only third party memory cards work due to some changes in wii mode still not handled by libogc.

    Protected Savegames
--------------------------
Protected gamesaves will only be able to be restored on the card it was backuped from. Even though, some protected savegames will still not work as some save protection rely in the situation of the gamesave on the memory card.

Protected savegames rely on the serial ID that is given to the memory card when it is formated. That's why they won't work in other cards and why they won't work on the same card if that has been formatted.

Restoring a raw image to a diferent card has still to be tested to see if that will permit using a protected gamesave on another memory card.

    Other savegame formats
----------------------------
There are computer programs that can transform other savegame formats into GCI.

GCP format is a raw savegame image of the memory card. At the moment creating a raw image is possible thanks to Masken, but there are still problems when restoring.

Unzip the archive. You will find the following folders inside:

apps			Contains Homebrew Channel ready files
				(see Homebrew Channel instructions below)
				
gamecube		Contains GameCube DOL file (not required for Wii)
				

    Wii
----------
On the Wii, the savegames will be read from and written to the front SD slot.
Memory card should be in slot B.


  Gamecube
------------
On the GameCube you will need a Gecko SD adapter in the slot A and place the memory card on slot B.

------------------------------
Loading / Running the app:
------------------------------

Wii - Via Homebrew Channel:
--------------------
The most popular method of running homebrew on the Wii is through the Homebrew
Channel. If you already have the channel installed, just copy over the apps folder
included in the archive into the root of your SD card.

If you haven't installed the Homebrew Channel yet, read about how to here:
http://hbc.hackmii.com/

Gamecube:
---------
You can load gcmm via sdload and an SD card in slot A, or by streaming 
it to your Gamecube, or by booting a bootable DVD with gcmm on it. 
This document doesn't cover how to do any of that. A good source for information 
on these topics is the tehskeen forums: http://www.tehskeen.com/forums/

*CowTRobo & Samsom for very useful old sources
*Tantric for pointing out that official memory cards won't work on wii mode, which encouraged me to continue gcmm as all my previous efforts where in vane due to using an official card for the testing.
